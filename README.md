# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction
Telecom Customer Churn Prediction using ML and DL algorithms 

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Identify missing values and handle them.  
Encode categorical features appropriately.  
Visualize key trends using plots.  
### 2. Classification Models
Naive Bayes: Probabilistic classification based on Bayes' Theorem.  
Decision Trees: Tree-based model for classifying customer churn.  
CNN: Deep learning model for feature extraction and classification.  
### 3. Binary Dataset Analysis
Cause-and-Effect Decision Tree: Analyze binary factors influencing churn.
### 4. Clustering
Remove class labels and segment customers into groups based on similarities.

### Datasets :
telecom_customer_churn_dataset.csv: For classification.  
telecom_customer_churn_dataset_binary.csv: For binary decision tree analysis.

### Dependencies : 
pandas, numpy – Data handling.  
seaborn, matplotlib – Visualization.  
scikit-learn – Machine learning models (Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Clustering).  
tensorflow – CNN implementation.
