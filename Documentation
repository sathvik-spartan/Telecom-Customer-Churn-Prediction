Telecom Customer Churn Prediction - Documentation

Overview

The Telecom Customer Churn Prediction project aims to analyze customer behavior and predict churn using machine learning techniques. The model helps telecom companies retain customers by identifying at-risk users based on various factors.

Features

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Machine Learning model training

Model evaluation and performance metrics

Deployment (if applicable)

Dataset

The dataset contains customer information such as:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer

Tenure: Duration of subscription

Monthly Charges: Billing amount per month

Total Charges: Cumulative charges

Contract Type: Monthly, Yearly, etc.

Payment Method: Credit card, Bank transfer, etc.

Services Subscribed: Internet, Streaming, etc.

Churn: Target variable (Yes/No)
